## 1.Project Description

In this contemporary era of on-line purchasing no seller wants to be left behind, moreover because of its simplicity the shift from offline selling version to an online promoting version is witnessing a rampant boom.<br>
Therefore, as an engineer our activity is to ease the path of this transition for the seller.
Amongst many stuff that a web web site calls for the maximum critical is a database machine. Subsequently in this mission we're planning to design a database where small garb dealers can sell their product on-line.
